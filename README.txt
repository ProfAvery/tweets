Starter Code for Problem Set 6

This is a branch of the Sample Code for Problem Set 5 that adds a simple
REST API and includes dependencies for Message Queueing.  You may use
this code as-is to complete Problem Set 6, or add similar functionality
to your own code.

See src/main/scripts for database schema and sample data.

Note that there are a couple of bug fixes/enhancements compared to the
master branch.  These may eventually be merged back into master.
